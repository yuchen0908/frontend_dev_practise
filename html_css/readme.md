There're some key points we can take away from this tutorial:
1. using semantic HTMLs when building web pages. This is because it's easy to understand the meaning of each part.
2. how to create anchors at the navigation bar, and link those anchors to each article/section of the page. Read Line 26 and 41 together. 
3. the major skeleton of a body is `header`, `main` and `footer`. 
    * Within `header`, we can create `nav`
    * within `main`, we may have a multiple `article`s or `section`s.
    * `footer` will be used to contain stuff like copyright, privacy policy, terms-and-conditions etc..
