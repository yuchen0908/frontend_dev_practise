My objective is to explore different methods to develop Map application. The first case is to get familiar with Leaflet. <br>
Some keypoints taken when developing the first case:
1. Mapbox provides the map while leaflet provides other functionalities.
2. Go to [leaflet quick start](https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/) and complete the section "Preparing you page"
3. I have done two things differently comparing to the original post:
    * loading MapTile by following the post [here](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/example/v1.0.0/plain-leaflet/)
    * loading geoJson via L.geoJson() function. [doc](https://leafletjs.com/examples/geojson/)

# useful resources:
1. [geoJson format](https://geojson.org/)
